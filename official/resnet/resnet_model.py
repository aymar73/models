"""Contains definitions for Residual Networks.

Residual networks ('v1' ResNets) were originally proposed in:
[1] Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
    Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition. arXiv:1512.03385

The full preactivation 'v2' ResNet variant was introduced by:
[2] Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
    Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks. arXiv: 1603.05027

The key difference of the full preactivation 'v2' variant compared to the
'v1' variant in [1] is the use of batch normalization before every weight layer
rather than after.
